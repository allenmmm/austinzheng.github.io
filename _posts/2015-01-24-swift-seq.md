If you've written code in Swift, you may have seen the `for in` (or **[foreach][link-foreach]**) loop at some point. For those who aren't acquainted with it, an simple example follows:

{% highlight swift %}
// prints "first", "second", and "third", each on its own line
for item in ["first", "second", "third"] {
    println(item)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This loop runs once for each object in the array. Each iteration, it binds the current object to the constant `item`, allowing the code within the loop to perform some operation based on that object. Since in this case the array contains strings, `item` is automatically inferred to be of type `String`.

It turns out you can also write a foreach loop to iterate over the items in a dictionary...

{% highlight swift %}
for (number, name) in [1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"] {
  println("The number \(number) is named \(name)")
}
{% endhighlight %}

...or a range.

{% highlight swift %}
var buffer = "0"
for index in 1..<10 {
  buffer += " \(index)"
}
// buffer is now "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"
{% endhighlight %}

But `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Range` are Swift built-in types. What if we wanted to build our own collection and iterate over it using a foreach loop? Let's build one and see...


## Building a Linked List ##

A [linked list][link-list] is a fundamental data structure. It consists of a chain of nodes which each contain a value, as well as a reference to the next node in the chain. Like an array, it stores zero or more elements in a specific order. Unlike an array, the elements don't need to be bunched up next to each other in memory.

One elegant way to reason about linked lists is to first imagine an *empty list*, a special list containing zero elements. We can then construct a list using the following technique:

* We start with the empty list: `[]`
* We prepend the first item `A` to the empty list to form a list with one element: `A --> []`
* Then we prepend the second item `B` to that list to form a list with two elements: `B --> A --> []`
* ...and so forth

A Swift implementation of a linked list using classes and inheritance follows:

{% highlight swift %}
class List<T> { }

final class ConsList<T> : List<T> {
  let value : T
  let next : List<T>

  init(_ value: T, next: List<T>) {
    self.value = value
    self.next = next
  }
}

final class NilList<T> : List<T> { }
{% endhighlight %}

Linked lists are recursive. The `NilList` class serves as our empty list and base case. All other lists are defined as a `ConsList` containing a value and followed by a slightly smaller linked list.


## Sequences and Generators ##

Now that we have a linked list type, we want to be able to iterate through the linked list nodes in order using a foreach loop.

The secret to doing so lies in the `SequenceType` protocol. In Swift, protocols can confer special powers to types that choose to conform to them, and `SequenceType` is no exception. Similar to how a type that adopts `Equatable` can be compared for equality using `==`, a type that adopts `SequenceType` can be used with foreach loops.

The `SequenceType` protocol defines a single function: `generate()`, which takes no arguments and returns a `Generator`. Let's go ahead and begin extending our `List` class:

{% highlight swift %}
// Initial attempt
extension List : SequenceType {
  func generate() -> Generator {
    // ???
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In order to proceed, we need to know what `generate()` is supposed to do, and what a `Generator` is.


### Generators ###

A **generator** is a helper object that is related to the sequence we want to iterate through. `Generator` is not the name of a predefined Swift class, but rather an *associated type* belonging to the `SequenceType` protocol. 

You can think of associated types as a 'blank' or 'wildcard' that you have to fill in when you write the code that makes your class or struct conform to the protocol. In this case, `SequenceType` wants us to define our own generator type and then have our `List`'s `generate()` method return one of those generators.

Let's sketch out a generator for our linked list type. If we look at the definition of `Generator`, we notice that our new generator has to conform to the `GeneratorType` protocol in order to qualify as a generator. `GeneratorType` in turn defines a single function, `next()`:

{% highlight swift %}
// Initial attempt
struct ListGenerator: GeneratorType {
  mutating func next() -> Element? {
    // ???
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `Element` is another associated type, this one belonging to the `GeneratorType` protocol. At this point, we have a bunch of interlocking components:

* We have our `List`, which needs to conform to `SequenceType`...
* ...and to do so, we've defined a `ListGenerator`.
* In turn, our `ListGenerator` has to conform to `GeneratorType`...
* ...which means we need to figure out what `Element` is.


### Purpose ###

To figure out how these components all fit together, we'll step back and discuss the roles that our generator, `generate()`, and `next()` functions are intended to fulfill.

A **generator** is a helper object associated with a sequence. At the beginning of the foreach loop, a generator for the sequence being iterated through is created using the `generate()` method.

The job of the generator is to repeatedly vend out the 'next' item in the sequence whenever its `next()` method is called. When the sequence is completely consumed, `next()` returns `nil`. In order to perform this job, the generator might need to keep track of state, such as its current position within the sequence.


### Building `ListGenerator` ###

Let's return to our `ListGenerator`. We want `next()` to return whatever type of element its parent `List` contains. Since `List` is generic, we should also make `ListGenerator` generic, and replace `Element` with `T`:

{% highlight swift %}
struct ListGenerator<T>: GeneratorType {
  mutating func next() -> T? {
    // ???
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our `ListGenerator` is going to walk through the list, advancing one node every time its `next()` method is called. In order to keep track of this state, let's add a property tracking the generator's current position, `currentNode`.

{% highlight swift %}
struct ListGenerator<T>: GeneratorType {
  // Note: our ListGenerator is a generator for a List of type T...
  var currentNode : List<T>

  // ...and our next() function returns an element of type T
  mutating func next() -> T? {
    // ???
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can fill out our `next()` function. We'll also add an initializer for good measure.

{% highlight swift %}
struct ListGenerator<T>: GeneratorType {
  var currentNode : List<T>

  init(head: List<T>) {
    currentNode = head
  }

  mutating func next() -> T? {
    switch currentNode {
    case let cons as ConsList<T>:
      currentNode = cons.next
      return cons.value
    default:  // e.g. nil node
      return nil
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`next()` does one of two things. If the current node is a `ConsList`, it advances the `currentNode` to the next node and then returns the current value. If the current node is the `NilList`, it just returns `nil`.

Now let's close the circle and finish implementing our `generate()` function.

{% highlight swift %}
extension List : SequenceType {
  func generate() -> ListGenerator<T> {
    return ListGenerator(head: self)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

All we're doing here is creating a fresh `ListGenerator` set to the first node in the list and returning it.


### Trying it out ###

At this point, we're done! Let's try it out. (Don't leave out the type annotation on `myList`; Swift's type inference engine still has issues.)

{% highlight swift %}
let myList : ConsList<Int> = ConsList(10,
  next: ConsList(15,
    next: ConsList(18,
      next: NilList())))

for item in myList {
  println("the item is \(item)")
}
// Output:
// the item is 10
// the item is 15
// the item is 18
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty cool! Our foreach-compatible `List` type takes its deserved place among the ranks of such exalted types as `Array` and `Sequence`.


## Lazy Sequences ##

What do collections like `List`, `Array`, and `Dictionary` have in common? They all have a finite number of items. But sequences don't need to be collections, nor do they even need to have a finite number of elements. A sequence can be something as unlikely as a constant flow of updates from the [USGS's live earthquake feed][link-eqfeed] or the digits of pi.

It's usually not feasible to pre-generate all the elements in an infinite sequence, so most such sequences are *lazy*; their elements are generated on-demand or as they become available. It turns out that the `SequenceType` and `GeneratorType` machinery we just learned about can be used to support lazy sequences in Swift.


### Collatz sequence ###

The [Collatz sequence][link-collatz], also known as the hailstone sequence, is a sequence defined by a simple algorithm that has a bizarre property: no matter what number you start off with, the sequence always seems to eventually reach 1. (Whether this is actually true for all numbers is not known.)

Let's build the Collatz sequence in Swift. In this case, our generator will be doing all the work, so our actual `Hailstone` struct is very simple:

{% highlight swift %}
struct Hailstone : SequenceType {
  let start : Int

  func generate() -> HailstoneGenerator {
    return HailstoneGenerator(value: start)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The generator is responsible for advancing the sequence. Since the Collatz sequence is infinite in length, it probably won't surprise you that `next()` never returns `nil`.

{% highlight swift %}
struct HailstoneGenerator : GeneratorType {
  var value : Int

  mutating func next() -> Int? {
    let this = value
    // If even, divide by 2. If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
    value = (value % 2 == 0) ? (value / 2) : (3*value + 1)
    return this
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can try it out! For fun, we'll use the `enumerate()` function (which works with any sequence type) to also get the indices of each hailstone number.

{% highlight swift %}
for (idx, hailstone) in enumerate(Hailstone(start: 91773)) {
  println("hailstone #\(idx + 1) is: \(hailstone)")
  if hailstone == 1 {
    break
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Can you build a `Hailstone` such that this loop runs forever? Go study mathematics for a decade, prove that it's possible or impossible before you turn 40, and win a Fields Medal!

Lazy sequences don't need to be infinite, of course. With a little bit of work we could add a `take` method to `Hailstone` which would return another `Hailstone` sequence consisting of the first `n` Collatz numbers.

{% highlight swift %}
let firstTwenty : Hailstone = Hailstone(start: 12345).take(20)
{% endhighlight %}

Or we could have our `take` method return a different type like `HailstoneSlice`, if we wanted to keep the distinction between infinite and finite sequences clear.


## The `map` Function ##

If you prefer functional programming, you may be familiar with the higher-order [map function][link-mapfn]. This function takes in a collection of items of type `T`, as well as a transforming function that maps inputs of type `T` to outputs of type `U`. It then returns another collection of items of type `U`, created by applying the transformer to each item from the input collection.

Here is a very simple example of `map` in action, taking in an array of integers and squaring each element:

{% highlight swift %}
func square(a: Int) -> Int { return a * a }

let output = map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], square)
println("output is: \(output)")
// prints: output is: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
{% endhighlight %}

Conceptually, `map` is similar to the foreach loop. Whereas the foreach loop contains code inside the loop body which has access to each element in turn, the `map` function takes in a mapping function that is fed each element of the input collection in turn.

Swift's standard library contains `map` as both a method defined on certain types like `Array`, as well as a `map` function that works with any sequence type and returns an array:

{% highlight swift %}
/// Return an `Array` containing the results of mapping `transform`
/// over `source`.
func map<S : SequenceType, T>(source: S, transform: (S.Generator.Element) -> T) -> [T]
{% endhighlight %}

If we wanted our `List` to have a `map` method, we'd need to define it ourselves. However, since our `List` conforms to `SequenceType`, we can use it with the `map` function without writing any additional code:

{% highlight swift %}
func square(a: Int) -> Int { return a * a }

let myList : ConsList<Int> = ConsList(1,
  next: ConsList(2,
    next: ConsList(3,
      next: ConsList(4,
        next:ConsList(5, next: NilList())))))
let output = map(myList, square)
println("output is: \(output)")
// prints: output is: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
{% endhighlight %}

In fact, our `List` (or any other `SequenceType` that we might build in the future) is automatically compatible with any function that works with sequences. For example, if we have a list containing comparable elements, we can use the standard library's `minElement()` and `maxElement()` functions to find the smallest or largest elements.


## Conclusion ##

Sequences are an example of a powerful form of abstraction that Swift adopts to great effect. Rather than baking language functionality into the compiler and granting it to only a handful of privileged built-in types, Swift *exposes* language features as protocols that any type can choose to adopt:

* Equatable types can adopt `Equatable` and be checked for equality using `==`.
* Types with an 'empty' or 'identity' value can adopt `NilLiteralConvertible` to have the compiler automatically treat `nil` as that identity value.
* Types that can be abstracted as sequences can adopt `SequenceType` and be used in foreach loops (and many other places).

A final note: I am indebted to Colin Eberhardt's [blog post on sequences][link-colin], which was one of the first good analyses of Swift's sequence and generator system. It is outdated, but still worth a read.
